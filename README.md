👋 Hi, I’m @GrantB83

👀 I’m passionate about **DeFi and Web3**, bridging my 21 years of microfinance expertise (scaled a business by 1100%!) to create impactful decentralized solutions for financial inclusion.
🌱 I’m currently mastering **Solidity, JavaScript, React, and Ethereum** through Metana’s Full-Stack & Web3 Bootcamp, building DeFi dApps like lending protocols and NFT marketplaces.
💞️ I’m eager to collaborate on **open-source DeFi projects** or Web3 product management initiatives, bringing strategic insights from my MBA and operations leadership.
📫 Reach me via **LinkedIn** www.linkedin.com/in/grant-brown1 or **email** grant@thebrowns.co.za for Web3 opportunities or coffee chats about decentralized finance!
😄 Pronouns: He/Him
⚡ Fun fact: I built my own chain of microloan stores, now I’m swapping microfinance for DeFi to empower global communities!
