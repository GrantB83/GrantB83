**Aspiring Web3 Product Manager | DeFi Enthusiast | Operations Leader Transitioning to Tech**

## About Me 👋

Dynamic entrepreneur with 21 years of operations and microfinance leadership, driving 1100% growth at 2Loan and 87% revenue growth at Hospitality Partners. Currently transitioning to Web3 Product Management through Metana’s Full-Stack, Web3, and Solidity Bootcamp (graduating November 2025), I’m passionate about building decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions that empower financial inclusion, inspired by my microfinance roots. As an MBA candidate (University of Suffolk, 2026), I blend strategic business acumen with emerging Web3 skills to create user-centric blockchain products.

Outside of tech, I enjoy exploring blockchain trends, engaging with aspiring entrepreneurs, and staying active in South Africa’s vibrant community. I’m excited to connect with Web3 innovators to collaborate on impactful projects.
